# Challenge1

Description:
For this challenge we had to edit lines of code for the Horiseon Marketing Agency so that it follows accessibility standards. To do this I added a new title and added alternates to the image. While doing that I made corrections to the semantics of the code and overall organization of the code. This way the code is easy to follow when reviewing.
